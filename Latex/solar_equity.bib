	abstract = {Energy equity and justice have become priority considerations for policymakers, practitioners, and scholars alike. To ensure that energy equity is incorporated into actual decisions and analysis, it is necessary to design, use, and continually improve energy equity metrics. In this article, we review the literature and practices surrounding such metrics. We present a working definition for energy justice and equity, and connect them to both criteria for and frameworks of metrics. We then present a large sampling of energy equity metrics, including those focused on vulnerability, wealth creation, energy poverty, life cycle, and comparative country-level dynamics.We conclude with a discussion of the limitations, gaps, and trade-offs associated with these various metrics and their interactions thereof.},

Pairing an empirical household-level dataset spanning United States geographies together with modeled hourly energy demand curves, we show that rooftop solar reduces energy burden across a majority of adopters during our study period from a median of 3.3\% to 2.6\%. For low- and moderate-income adopters (at or below 80\% and 120\% of area median income, respectively), solar reduces median 2021 energy burden from 7.7\% to 6.2\%, and 4.1\% to 3.3\%, respectively. Importantly, solar reduces the rate of high or severe energy burden from 67\% of all low-income households before adoption to 52\% of households following adoption, and correspondingly from 21\% to 13\% for moderate-income households. Here, we show rooftop solar can support policy goals to reduce energy burden along with strategies such as weatherization and bill assistance.},

	abstract = {Over the last decade, the United States has experienced continued growth in residential rooftop solar photovoltaic ({PV}) adoption. However, solar adoption disparities have been shown across household income, homeownership status, and more recently racial and ethnic demographics. A key component to ensuring a just clean energy transition is understanding the existing landscape to establish realistic goals. Motivated by studies on solar adoption disparities, this descriptive study aims to evaluate the distribution of estimated single-family rooftop potential across racial and ethnic majority census tracts to discern whether rooftop potential disparities may justify solar adoption disparities. Across all census tracts, the median rooftop potential was 80\%. Three-fourths of all census tracts had a rooftop potential greater than 72\%, regardless of racial/ethnic majority. Compared to majority-white census tracts, majority-Black, majority-Hispanic, and majority-Asian census tracts had slightly lower rooftop potential, 6\%, 7\%, and 9\%, respectively, while majority-American Indian census tracts had an 11\% higher rooftop potential. The slightly lower rooftop potential in communities of color compared to majority-white and non-racial/ethnic majority census tracts, alone, was not of the magnitude to justify documented racial/ethnic disparities in solar adoption. This study concludes, that while a majority of homes in communities of color are solar suitable, an equitable clean energy transition is only possible with policies, programs, and incentives that center on racial equity while recognizing the interplay between race, income, and homeownership status.},

We find persistently lower levels of {PV} adoption in disadvantaged communities, suggesting clear distributive and equity impacts of existing {PV} support policies, and indicating that the benefits bypass some of the state's most vulnerable populations. The analysis reveals strong correlation of solar adoption with not only socioeconomic variables, but also with health, environmental and demographic indicators, contributing to our growing understanding of the role these factors play in household clean-energy adoption trends. The results provide a baseline from which to develop more effective policies, strategically design incentives, and track the efficacy of existing solar programs that target disadvantaged communities.},

To date, researchers have focused on demand-side drivers of {PV} adoption inequity, but supply-side factors could also play a role. Here, we use quote data to explore whether {PV} installers implement income-targeted marketing and the extent to which such strategies drive adoption inequity. We ﬁnd that installers submit fewer quotes to households in low-income areas and those households that receive fewer quotes are less likely to adopt. The data suggest that income-targeted marketing explains about one-quarter of the difference in {PV} adoption rates between {LMI} and higher-income households.

In this study we analysed grid limits to new {DER} integration across California’s two largest utility territories. We found that grid limits reduce access to solar photovoltaics to less than half of households served by these two utilities, and may hinder California’s electric vehicle adoption and residential load electrification goals. We connected these results to demographic characteristics and found that grid limits also exacerbate existing inequities: households in increasingly Black-identifying and disadvantaged census block groups have disproportionately less access to new solar photovoltaic capacity based on circuit hosting capacity. Our results illuminate the need for equity goals to be an input in the design of policies for prioritizing grid upgrades.},

However, concerns have emerged that the benefits of rooftop solar deployment are inequitably distributed across demographic groups. Previous work has highlighted inequity in national solar adopter deployment and income trends. We leverage a dataset of {US} solar adopter household income estimates—unique in its size and resolution—to analyze differences in adoption equity at the local level and identify those conditions that yield more equitable solar adoption, with implications for policy strategies to reduce inequities in solar adoption. The solar inequities observed at the national and state levels also exist at more granular levels, but not uniformly so; some {US} census tracts exhibit less solar inequity than others. Some demographic, solar system, and market characteristics robustly lead to more equitable solar adoption. Our findings suggest that while solar adoption inequity is frequently attributed to the relatively high costs of solar adoption, costs may become less relevant as solar prices decline. Results also indicate that racial diversity and education levels affect solar adoption patterns at a local level. Finally, we find that solar adoption is more equitable in census tracts served by specific types of installers. Future research and policy can explore ways to leverage these findings to accelerate the transition to equitable solar adoption.},

Analyzing the tradeoff is much more challenging than often presumed because the value of electricity is extremely dependent on the time and location at which it is produced, which is not very controllable with some renewables, such as wind and solar. Likewise, the pollution benefits from renewable generation depend on what type of generation it displaces, which also depends on time and location. Without incorporating these factors, cost-benefit analyses of alternatives are likely to be misleading. Other common arguments for subsidizing renewable power—green jobs, energy security, and driving down fossil energy prices—are unlikely to substantially alter the analysis. The role of intellectual property spillovers is a strong argument for subsidizing energy science research, but less persuasive as an enhancement to the value of installing current renewable energy technologies.},

California has led the growth in {DG} solar in the United States. I use 2007 to early 2014 residential data from Pacific Gas \& Electric—the utility with the largest number of residential solar customers in the United States—to examine the full range of private incentives for installing residential solar, from direct rebates and tax credits to indirect incentives that result from the residential tariff design and the crediting of solar production under “net energy metering.” I then study the income distribution of solar adopters and how that has changed over time. I find the skew to wealthy households adopting solar is still significant but began to lessen after 2011. Adoption continued to be dominated by the heaviest electricity-consuming households, probably because the steeply tiered tariff structure greatly increased the private value of solar to such customers while reducing the incentive for consumers who are below median consumption. In fact, the financial incentive for those who actually adopted solar over the sample period may have been due nearly as much to California’s tiered tariff structure as to the 30\% federal tax credit. The California experience suggests that rate design can greatly influence the economic incentives for residential solar adoption and which customers receive those benefits.},

	abstract = {This paper surveys energy policy in the United States from a distributional perspective. Focusing on the distributional impacts of energy taxes is too narrow a framework. The United States relies much more heavily on regulation than taxation to address energy-related market failures. It argues that most regulatory policies and tax subsidies to achieve energy policy goals are regressive. This includes fuel economy standards, {EV} purchase incentives, and energy efficiency tax incentives. In contrast, a carbon tax is likely to be progressive, even when ignoring the use of revenue. The view that carbon taxes are regressive stems from an incomplete distributional analysis that assumes all impacts arise from increases in the costs of consumer goods and services. Recent analyses have emphasized the importance of impacts on sources of income. In particular, a carbon tax is likely to reduce returns to capital more than wages. With capital disproportionately held by higher income households, this differential factor income effect is progressive. In addition, transfer income, more important for lower income households, tends to be indexed and so contributes to a carbon tax's progressivity. How carbon tax revenue is used can add even greater progressivity to a carbon tax reform.},

Tax credits, utility rebates, and subsidies for home energy audits have similar levels of inequality by race and ethnicity. Subsidies for efficient light bulbs have a more equal rate of uptake.

	shorttitle = {Operationalizing social equity in public policy design},
	abstract = {While it is widely recognized that energy injustices are prevalent in the clean energy transition process, there has been limited research attention on policy efforts aiming to mitigate these inequities. In this paper, we use solar equity policies as an empirical case study to understand how social equity considerations are conceptualized and operationalized in energy policy content. We build upon the policy design literature and code institutional statements of 54 solar equity policies adopted between 2001 and 2021 in the United States. In our comparative analysis, we focus on three levels of policy design elements that can be directly observed in written policy language: macro-policy goal construction, meso-policy instrument choices, and micro-level policy settings and calibrations. We find that the policy goal of energy justice is multifaceted, with a great emphasis on solar energy accessibility and provision of economic benefits and security for disadvantaged communities. There is a dominant preference by policymakers to use redistributive policies and community solar programs to advance energy justice-related goals. Solar equity policy instruments on-the-ground measures have also been calibrated to target specific disadvantaged populations in the energy system, which focus mostly on income-based vulnerability.},

	abstract = {If some households are less likely to be able to participate in solar panel adoption due to socio-economic or demographic characteristics, then inequity can exist. We use meta-regressions to analyse links between research characteristics and dimensions of equity including gender, economic distributions, renting, education, and ethnicity. We find that studies assessing actual solar panel uptake rather than intentions are less likely to analyse gender influences. Cross-sectional studies are more likely to include analyses of economic distributions and renting impacts but are less likely to assess policy variables. We also investigate links between research characteristics and prior findings. Significant influences of equity on solar panel uptake are 17 percentage points (p.p.) and 10 p.p. less likely to be found with regard to education and ethnicity, respectively, in household-level studies compared to aggregated studies. Our paper encourages more frequent analysis of equity aspects, coverage of a broader range of equity aspects, and analysis that incorporates both equity and policy variables. For research questions on household equity, we suggest using data on actual solar-panel uptake at the household level.},
